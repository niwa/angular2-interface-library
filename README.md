#Fire service

This is another approach to kick start our development effort but without AngularCLI.

This is pure Angular2 + Webpack + Bootstrap

Install the dependencies with

```
npm install
```

Run the tests with
```
npm test
```

To run the server locally with CLI monitor
```
npm start
```

To set the environment for dev run 
```
npm run env-dev
```

To set the environment for uat run 
```
npm run env-uat
```

To set the environment for prod run 
```
npm run env-prod
```


Find the test coverage under 'coverage' in the project.

Read up on webpack, read through the config file.


This project is basing on this starter
